        <h1 class="title">My Non-Academic Achivements</h1>
        <p>This are all my awards certificates. The first one is the Singapore Chinese Model Untied Nations (2022). I took part in the Model United Nations 2022 hosted by Singapore Chinese Girl School and was the delegate of Brunei. I learnt about debate and more of education around the world. This is then followed by two GNS certificates of achievements. This certificate is a representation of my skill in photography and in Architecture design.</p>
